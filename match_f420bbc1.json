Yet the Revenant's armor seemed as though forged from the very bones of the earth, impervious to Veyra's ghostly tendrils. Her cold iron glancing off the grave-fire which surrounded him, dealing but a shallow wound.\n\nSeizing the opportunity, Gravaul rose with inexorable force, his blades imbued with malevolent vigor. The advantage of the Revenant against the ethereal Specter was writ in his every movement, an overwhelming force that did not relent. In a surge, perfected by the position of dominance, Gravaul struck mightily, the Revenant's attack shattering Veyra's ephemeral form utterly. She dissipated, a memory drawn back into the Veil's embrace.\n\nLyra felt the sting of loss, as her prized Specter dissolved, while Kael Duskmantle's stance only grew stronger, holding fast against the ebbing tides of shadow. The round decisively belonged to Kael, Gravaul's unyielding prowess leaving no doubt as to the dominion of the living dead in this opening bout.",
